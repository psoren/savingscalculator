# House Savings Calculator

This House Savings Calculator is a Python program created with ChatGPT. It helps you estimate how long it will take to save up for a house down payment based on your current savings, monthly contributions, and desired savings goal. The program takes into account different stages of savings, such as the potential for increased monthly savings when you get a new job, and calculates your investment value per month until your house saving goal is reached.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the `house_savings_calculator.py` file.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `house_savings_calculator.py` file is located.

4. Run the Python script by typing the following command:

   ```bash
   python house_savings_calculator.py
The program will prompt you for the following inputs:

Your birthday (e.g., Dec 1 1990)

Your initial savings amount (e.g., 10,000, 50,000, 250k)

Annual rate of return on investment as a decimal (e.g., 0.10 for 10%)

Your current savings amount per month (e.g., 1000, 5,000, 100k)

If you have a new job where you can save more per month (yes or no)

If you have a new job, the month and year when the new job starts (e.g., July 2023)

If you have a new job, the new savings amount per month (e.g., 2000, 50,000, 80k)

The amount you want to save for the house (e.g., 30000, 500,000, 800k)

The program will then calculate and display the investment value per month until your house saving goal is reached.
